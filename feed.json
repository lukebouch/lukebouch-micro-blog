I only paid a few dollars after trading in my old iPhone XS, and it made sense to take advantage of the offer while my XS was still worth something.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, I had done very little research on the mini before ordering it, but I knew Apple had significant improved the issues found on the iPhone 12 mini. I can say after using it over the last week I’m pleased with it, and I’m enjoying the smaller size. It’s a bit more difficult to type on when compared to the large screen of the XS, but the compromise is well worth the benefits of a smaller and more affordable phone.</p>\n\n<p>With the large discount, I received on the phone, I decided to purchase a better quality case than I normally do. I opted to go with the first-party Apple MagSafe silicon case. This is the first time I have ever had an Apple case and I can say it is well worth the price. I like the traction my hand has on the soft silicon and overall, it has a very premium feel.</p>\n\n<p>The battery on the 13 mini is surprisingly good when compared to my XS. I usually get through the day with 50-60% left.</p>\n\n<p>The camera is a massive upgrade for me. Both cameras have exceptional quality and the night mode is outstanding!</p>\n\n<p>Overall, I’ve really enjoyed my new phone and look forward to continuing to testing it.</p>\n",

I only paid a few dollars after trading in my old iPhone XS, and it made sense to take advantage of the offer while my XS was still worth something. \n\nFurthermore, I had done very little research on the mini before ordering it, but I knew Apple had significant improved the issues found on the iPhone 12 mini. I can say after using it over the last week I’m pleased with it, and I’m enjoying the smaller size. It’s a bit more difficult to type on when compared to the large screen of the XS, but the compromise is well worth the benefits of a smaller and more affordable phone. \n\nWith the large discount, I received on the phone, I decided to purchase a better quality case than I normally do. I opted to go with the first-party Apple MagSafe silicon case. This is the first time I have ever had an Apple case and I can say it is well worth the price. I like the traction my hand has on the soft silicon and overall, it has a very premium feel. \n\nThe battery on the 13 mini is surprisingly good when compared to my XS. I usually get through the day with 50-60% left. \n\nThe camera is a massive upgrade for me. Both cameras have exceptional quality and the night mode is outstanding!\n\nOverall, I’ve really enjoyed my new phone and look forward to continuing to testing it. \n\n",
