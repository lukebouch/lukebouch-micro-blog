         	<p>Last night I deployed Sublime Blogs to production to test everything out as it stands. The markdown editor completely broke so I got it working locally. Still no luck on production. I’m not getting any error codes or logs either. I will take a look at it tomorrow and see if I can figure out the issue.</p>

         	<p>Over the past several months, I have been trying to decide whether or not to cancel my Google Workspaces subscription. I use it for my business email and I’m grandfathered in to an unlimited storage plan for only $12/month.</p>

<p>I used to use it as my main form of storage for all the client work I did but I have since decided I don’t want all my data in the hands of Google, especially not the only copy I have, so I purchased a Synology NAS. Now comes the part where I have to migrate 2TB of data from Google Drive to my NAS. Fun 😞</p>

<p>I won’t really by using much storage on Google Drive but I don’t like the thought of giving up my grandfathered in plan.</p>

<p>I don’t share as much data with clients anymore (now I’m doing mostly web developer and that is all on GitHub) so I could just throw any files I need to share on an S3 bucket. Maybe even throw that behind CloudFlare for caching.</p>

         	<p>I have been making progress on Sublime Blogs. It has been going rather smoothly. It’s always that way whenever I start a new project. Sort of deceitful… it gets much harder down the road. Currently, I’m just setting up everything, defining the database schema, and creating the basic dashboard.</p>

<p>It took me a while to finally decided on a javascript text editor to use on the front-end. I have three major requirements. It has to support markdown, allow image uploading, and be open source, so I can tweak and customize as needed without having to worry about licensing.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Ionaru/easy-markdown-editor">Easy Markdown Editor</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/Ionaru/easy-markdown-editor">EasyMDE</a> for short, fulfilled all three of those requirements and as a bonus, has a great UI. It’s a fork of <a href="https://github.com/sparksuite/simplemde-markdown-editor">SimpleMDE</a> with a few added features. After a few hours of work, I was able to get the editor to send its content, on update, back to whatever <a href="https://laravel-livewire.com/">Livewire</a> component it is embedded in. It may not be the most elegant&hellip; but it works.</p>

         	<p>Inspired by Sublime Ads (a SaaS Vincent Ritter is developing), Sublime Blogs is a new project I’m working on. It is a Headless CMS designed specifically to add a blog to any frontend static site generator.</p>

<p>After doing a lot of research, I’m yet to find a cheap and simple solution to move my blog over to Netlify. I’m very particular about my tech stack, and I want to be able to use the tooling I’m familiar with (Jigsaw and Tailwindcss) while still being able to post blog posts easily from my phone.</p>

<p>I decided to solve my problem by building Sublime Blogs. More information coming soon…</p>

<p>It seems like I go through phases of posting frequently, and then it feels like nothing interesting happens for a while and I neglect to write anything.</p>

<p>I have been working on a few projects that some may find interesting. I have outlined them below.</p>

<h2 id="vue-js">Vue JS</h2>

<p>I have been working on learning Vue JS. For those of you that are not familiar with Vue, it’s very similar to React (a piece of technology built and used by Facebook (now Meta)<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>).</p>

<p>I’m enjoying using it so far. I have the tendency to jump in head first instead of working through tutorials, so progress on the app I’m working on is a bit slow. I will post more about it soon.</p>

<h2 id="bmw-f650gs">BMW f650gs</h2>

<p>I have been working on replacing the clutch in my 2001 BMW f650gs. It’s a bit tricky and the stack height on the new one I think is a little too tall. Hopefully it works.</p>

<p>I know there are more projects, but honestly, I started writing out this post several days ago, and now I forgot what I was going to say. Oops 😬</p>

<p>I know there were at least 10 dumb mistakes that were made to get to this point. I got stuck in the very wet and leafy ground out at my cousin&rsquo;s house. He came and rescued the day (or, by that point, night) and helped me get out.</p>

         	<p>I have been fairly busy lately, and I have fallen behind on a few things. Including the Swift and SwiftUI course I have been working on.</p>

<p>I have been trying to decide whether to move forward with it or not. It takes quite a bit of time dedication (about 1hr a day) and I’m a long ways of from behind able to actually profit from the time spent.</p>

<p>I’m thinking I’m better off focusing on the web for now. I started dabbling in Vue JS and I have a cool project that would make a good PWA.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I also don’t feel like getting into the whole Apple vs. developers issues right now. At the same time, though, I want to be able to at least have some control over my iOS devices by being able to write my own apps. The web is remarkable and powerful, but there are just some things you can’t do without a native app.</p>

<p>I restarted my <a href="laracasts.com">Laracasts</a> subscription, which is a fantastic resource for learning web development, so I want to devote more time to increasing my knowledge of Laravel and related technologies. Since I’m paying for it, I might as well take full advantage of it. Plus, I know enough about Laravel and Livewire to actually take on some small projects. It makes sense to dedicate time to something I can build a career out of now, rather than working on learning something I know very little about.</p>

<p>I started writing this post thinking I had already made up my mind… but now I’m back to not being sure what I want to do now 😂</p>

<p>We will see.</p>

<p>They make smart home devices, for Pete’s sake. I know it is just for marketing reasons, but every company does not need to be everything. Just continue making light bulbs. And if you can, make a <strong>really good</strong> light bulb.</p>

<p>We arrived at the Ark Encounter about 15 mins before they opened. We purchased our tickets and then took a shuttle from the parking lot to the actual Ark Encounter.</p>

<p>The Ark was massive! It was remarkable to be able to walk through all three decks of the Ark and see the different exhibits explaining what Noah and his sons may have been doing while on the Ark.</p>

<p>A few things stood out to me. The first is that it would have been very dark in the Ark. The only light they would have had during the storm would have been a few candles or oil lights.</p>

<p>Another thing that stood out to me was that Noah and his family would have had to work very hard while in the Ark taking care of the animals. After spending 100 years building it, Noah was not even able to rest while on the Ark.</p>

<p>The last thing, which may be obvious to some, it would have smelled horrible in the Ark as it would have been all closed up and there would not have been much airflow.</p>

<p>We made some great memories and I came back with some fantastic photos.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Last week, I received my iPhone 13 mini after ordering it a few days prior. I decided to upgrade from my iPhone XS to the 13 mini because Verizon was running a promotional. I only paid a few dollars after trading in my old iPhone XS, and it made sense to take advantage of the offer while my XS was still worth something.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I had done very little research on the mini before ordering it, but I knew Apple had significant improved the issues found on the iPhone 12 mini. I can say after using it over the last week I’m pleased with it, and I’m enjoying the smaller size. It’s a bit more difficult to type on when compared to the large screen of the XS, but the compromise is well worth the benefits of a smaller and more affordable phone.</p>

<p>With the large discount, I received on the phone, I decided to purchase a better quality case than I normally do. I opted to go with the first-party Apple MagSafe silicon case. This is the first time I have ever had an Apple case and I can say it is well worth the price. I like the traction my hand has on the soft silicon and overall, it has a very premium feel.</p>

<p>The battery on the 13 mini is surprisingly good when compared to my XS. I usually get through the day with 50-60% left.</p>

<p>The camera is a massive upgrade for me. Both cameras have exceptional quality and the night mode is outstanding!</p>

<p>Overall, I’ve really enjoyed my new phone and look forward to continuing to testing it.</p>

Hopefully this will improve speeds now that I have a wired connection and increase WiFi coverage on this side of the house.

         	<p>I had the blessing to be able to go on a trip four wheeling in West Virginia with three of my best friends. We departed on May 6th and spent two nights in an old school in Gary, WV.</p>

<p>Here we are getting ready to leave early Thursday morning.</p>

<p><img src="https://lukebouch.com/uploads/2021/e9176b7c6e.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We got stuck in traffic which set us back about an hour or so.</p>

<p><img src="https://lukebouch.com/uploads/2021/d8e97a5013.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Here we are not long after getting on the trails.</p>

<p><img src="https://lukebouch.com/uploads/2021/cc8f531567.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We had a few minor mechanical failures, one of which was my chain fell off on the trail. I was able to get it back on but had to milk it until we got to City of War. We found a really nice family that could get the chain tight enough to get us back to the school. We were running short on time, and so we had to take the road back which took about ~45mins.</p>

<p>This room at the school is currently under construction, but it looks really cool so far. I hope we get the chance to go back again soon!</p>

         	<p>About a year ago, my uncle and I had to tackle the HVAC wiring at church and to say the least, it was very complicated. From antique equipment to old four wire mercury thermostats, it took two brains to finally install our new five wire ecobee thermostats.</p>

         	<p>I have been working on my 2007 Chevy Colorado for a while now. I just finished up restoring my bumper. I had to sand it down, fill the dents with Bondo, and then primer, paint, and final apply a 2k clear coat.</p>

<p>For the base coat, I used spray paint that was custom mixed for the original factory color. I purchased the base coat, clear coat, and a touch up bottle from <a href="automotivetouchup.com">automotive touch up</a> and highly recommend them.</p>

<p>I’m rather pleased with how it turned out and just have to finish it up by polishing and waxing it.</p>

         	<p>I’m currently building a minimalistic house on my Minecraft server that will act like the entrance to a secret underground bunker. I would like it to look cabin like and needs to look very humble. Furthermore, I plan to build several buildings around it to be like a village/town.</p>
