         	<p>I’m working on my electrical license and this video was very accurate with its explanation of the flaws in our extension cords here in the US. I wish more people understood wire gauge and the amount of current you can safely run through each size.</p>

         	<p>I had the blessing to be able to go on a trip four wheeling in West Virginia with three of my best friends. We departed on May 6th and spent two nights in an old school in Gary, WV.</p>

<p>Here we are getting ready to leave early Thursday morning.</p>

<p><img src="https://lukebouch.com/uploads/2021/e9176b7c6e.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We got stuck in traffic which set us back about an hour or so.</p>

<p><img src="https://lukebouch.com/uploads/2021/d8e97a5013.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Here we are not long after getting on the trails.</p>

<p><img src="https://lukebouch.com/uploads/2021/cc8f531567.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We had a few minor mechanical failures, one of which was my chain fell off on the trail. I was able to get it back on but had to milk it until we got to City of War. We found a really nice family that could get the chain tight enough to get us back to the school. We were running short on time, and so we had to take the road back which took about ~45mins.</p>

<p>This room at the school is currently under construction, but it looks really cool so far. I hope we get the chance to go back again soon!</p>

         	<p>About a year ago, my uncle and I had to tackle the HVAC wiring at church and to say the least, it was very complicated. From antique equipment to old four wire mercury thermostats, it took two brains to finally install our new five wire ecobee thermostats.</p>

         	<p>I have been working on my 2007 Chevy Colorado for a while now. I just finished up restoring my bumper. I had to sand it down, fill the dents with Bondo, and then primer, paint, and final apply a 2k clear coat.</p>

<p>For the base coat, I used spray paint that was custom mixed for the original factory color. I purchased the base coat, clear coat, and a touch up bottle from <a href="automotivetouchup.com">automotive touch up</a> and highly recommend them.</p>

<p>I’m rather pleased with how it turned out and just have to finish it up by polishing and waxing it.</p>

         	<p>I’m currently building a minimalistic house on my Minecraft server that will act like the entrance to a secret underground bunker. I would like it to look cabin like and needs to look very humble. Furthermore, I plan to build several buildings around it to be like a village/town.</p>
