<p>I put new tires on my 1999 Honda Nighthawk 750. I did it by hand, and It was not too hard.</p>

<p>I know there were at least 10 dumb mistakes that were made to get to this point. I got stuck in the very wet and leafy ground out at my cousin&rsquo;s house. He came and rescued the day (or, by that point, night) and helped me get out.</p>

         	<p>I have been fairly busy lately, and I have fallen behind on a few things. Including the Swift and SwiftUI course I have been working on.</p>

<p>I have been trying to decide whether to move forward with it or not. It takes quite a bit of time dedication (about 1hr a day) and I’m a long ways of from behind able to actually profit from the time spent.</p>

<p>I’m thinking I’m better off focusing on the web for now. I started dabbling in Vue JS and I have a cool project that would make a good PWA.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I also don’t feel like getting into the whole Apple vs. developers issues right now. At the same time, though, I want to be able to at least have some control over my iOS devices by being able to write my own apps. The web is remarkable and powerful, but there are just some things you can’t do without a native app.</p>

<p>I restarted my <a href="laracasts.com">Laracasts</a> subscription, which is a fantastic resource for learning web development, so I want to devote more time to increasing my knowledge of Laravel and related technologies. Since I’m paying for it, I might as well take full advantage of it. Plus, I know enough about Laravel and Livewire to actually take on some small projects. It makes sense to dedicate time to something I can build a career out of now, rather than working on learning something I know very little about.</p>

<p>I started writing this post thinking I had already made up my mind… but now I’m back to not being sure what I want to do now 😂</p>

<p>We will see.</p>

<p>We arrived at the Ark Encounter about 15 mins before they opened. We purchased our tickets and then took a shuttle from the parking lot to the actual Ark Encounter.</p>

<p>The Ark was massive! It was remarkable to be able to walk through all three decks of the Ark and see the different exhibits explaining what Noah and his sons may have been doing while on the Ark.</p>

<p>A few things stood out to me. The first is that it would have been very dark in the Ark. The only light they would have had during the storm would have been a few candles or oil lights.</p>

<p>Another thing that stood out to me was that Noah and his family would have had to work very hard while in the Ark taking care of the animals. After spending 100 years building it, Noah was not even able to rest while on the Ark.</p>

<p>The last thing, which may be obvious to some, it would have smelled horrible in the Ark as it would have been all closed up and there would not have been much airflow.</p>

<p>We made some great memories and I came back with some fantastic photos.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Last week, I received my iPhone 13 mini after ordering it a few days prior. I decided to upgrade from my iPhone XS to the 13 mini because Verizon was running a promotional. I only paid a few dollars after trading in my old iPhone XS, and it made sense to take advantage of the offer while my XS was still worth something.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I had done very little research on the mini before ordering it, but I knew Apple had significant improved the issues found on the iPhone 12 mini. I can say after using it over the last week I’m pleased with it, and I’m enjoying the smaller size. It’s a bit more difficult to type on when compared to the large screen of the XS, but the compromise is well worth the benefits of a smaller and more affordable phone.</p>

<p>With the large discount, I received on the phone, I decided to purchase a better quality case than I normally do. I opted to go with the first-party Apple MagSafe silicon case. This is the first time I have ever had an Apple case and I can say it is well worth the price. I like the traction my hand has on the soft silicon and overall, it has a very premium feel.</p>

<p>The battery on the 13 mini is surprisingly good when compared to my XS. I usually get through the day with 50-60% left.</p>

<p>The camera is a massive upgrade for me. Both cameras have exceptional quality and the night mode is outstanding!</p>

<p>Overall, I’ve really enjoyed my new phone and look forward to continuing to testing it.</p>

<p>I also ran a Cat 6 wire to an WiFi access point which also acts as a ethernet switch. Hopefully this will improve speeds now that I have a wired connection and increase WiFi coverage on this side of the house. Oh&hellip; and I also have my Synology DS418 with 2x 4TB Seagate IronWolf drives in it. It is also wired directly into the access point.</p>

         	<p>I had the blessing to be able to go on a trip four wheeling in West Virginia with three of my best friends. We departed on May 6th and spent two nights in an old school in Gary, WV.</p>

<p>Here we are getting ready to leave early Thursday morning.</p>

<p><img src="https://lukebouch.com/uploads/2021/e9176b7c6e.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We got stuck in traffic which set us back about an hour or so.</p>

<p><img src="https://lukebouch.com/uploads/2021/d8e97a5013.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Here we are not long after getting on the trails.</p>

<p><img src="https://lukebouch.com/uploads/2021/cc8f531567.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We had a few minor mechanical failures, one of which was my chain fell off on the trail. I was able to get it back on but had to milk it until we got to City of War. We found a really nice family that could get the chain tight enough to get us back to the school. We were running short on time, and so we had to take the road back which took about ~45mins.</p>

<p>This room at the school is currently under construction, but it looks really cool so far. I hope we get the chance to go back again soon!</p>

         	<p>About a year ago, my uncle and I had to tackle the HVAC wiring at church and to say the least, it was very complicated. From antique equipment to old four wire mercury thermostats, it took two brains to finally install our new five wire ecobee thermostats.</p>

         	<p>I have been working on my 2007 Chevy Colorado for a while now. I just finished up restoring my bumper. I had to sand it down, fill the dents with Bondo, and then primer, paint, and final apply a 2k clear coat.</p>

<p>For the base coat, I used spray paint that was custom mixed for the original factory color. I purchased the base coat, clear coat, and a touch up bottle from <a href="automotivetouchup.com">automotive touch up</a> and highly recommend them.</p>

<p>I’m rather pleased with how it turned out and just have to finish it up by polishing and waxing it.</p>
