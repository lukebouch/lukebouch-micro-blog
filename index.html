        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Last week, I received my iPhone 13 mini after ordering it a few days prior. I decided to upgrade from my iPhone XS to the 13 mini because Verizon was running a promotional. I only paid a few dollars after trading in my old iPhone XS, and it made sense to take advantage of the offer while my XS was still worth something.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I had done very little research on the mini before ordering it, but I knew Apple had significant improved the issues found on the iPhone 12 mini. I can say after using it over the last week Iâ€™m pleased with it, and Iâ€™m enjoying the smaller size. Itâ€™s a bit more difficult to type on when compared to the large screen of the XS, but the compromise is well worth the benefits of a smaller and more affordable phone.</p>

<p>With the large discount, I received on the phone, I decided to purchase a better quality case than I normally do. I opted to go with the first-party Apple MagSafe silicon case. This is the first time I have ever had an Apple case and I can say it is well worth the price. I like the traction my hand has on the soft silicon and overall, it has a very premium feel.</p>

<p>The battery on the 13 mini is surprisingly good when compared to my XS. I usually get through the day with 50-60% left.</p>

<p>The camera is a massive upgrade for me. Both cameras have exceptional quality and the night mode is outstanding!</p>

<p>Overall, Iâ€™ve really enjoyed my new phone and look forward to continuing to testing it.</p>

         	<p>I finally decided to order a new iPad Air. I have had my iPad 6th generation for about 3 years now and with the trade in value of it, it made sense to upgrade.</p>

         	<p>Here a few photos I have taken over the last two days with the Sony a6300. I think they turned out great! I did a few touch-ups in post but overall the photos were very good straight out of the camera.</p>

         	<p>Today I purchased a Sony a6300. I got a great deal on it used, and it came with four lenses. I have been testing it out a little, and it is a big upgrade from my Canon Rebel t3i. I will post some photos I have taken with it tomorrow.</p>

<p>I mounted a small shelf underneath my desk where I can place my MacBook Pro while it is plugged into my Caldigit TS3 Plus.</p>

<p><img src="https://lukebouch.com/uploads/2021/a0ca2f5f76.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I also ran a Cat 6 wire to an WiFi access point which also acts as a ethernet switch. Hopefully this will improve speeds now that I have a wired connection and increase WiFi coverage on this side of the house. Oh&hellip; and I also have my Synology DS418 with 2x 4TB Seagate IronWolf drives in it. It is also wired directly into the access point.</p>

         	<p>I had the blessing to be able to go on a trip four wheeling in West Virginia with three of my best friends. We departed on May 6th and spent two nights in an old school in Gary, WV.</p>

<p>Here we are getting ready to leave early Thursday morning.</p>

<p><img src="https://lukebouch.com/uploads/2021/e9176b7c6e.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We got stuck in traffic which set us back about an hour or so.</p>

<p><img src="https://lukebouch.com/uploads/2021/d8e97a5013.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Here we are not long after getting on the trails.</p>

<p><img src="https://lukebouch.com/uploads/2021/b53d085122.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="https://lukebouch.com/uploads/2021/cc8f531567.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We had a few minor mechanical failures, one of which was my chain fell off on the trail. I was able to get it back on but had to milk it until we got to City of War. We found a really nice family that could get the chain tight enough to get us back to the school. We were running short on time, and so we had to take the road back which took about ~45mins.</p>

<p>This room at the school is currently under construction, but it looks really cool so far. I hope we get the chance to go back again soon!</p>

         	<p>About a year ago, my uncle and I had to tackle the HVAC wiring at church and to say the least, it was very complicated. From antique equipment to old four wire mercury thermostats, it took two brains to finally install our new five wire ecobee thermostats.</p>

         	<p>I have been working on my 2007 Chevy Colorado for a while now. I just finished up restoring my bumper. I had to sand it down, fill the dents with Bondo, and then primer, paint, and final apply a 2k clear coat.</p>

<p>For the base coat, I used spray paint that was custom mixed for the original factory color. I purchased the base coat, clear coat, and a touch up bottle from <a href="automotivetouchup.com">automotive touch up</a> and highly recommend them.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m rather pleased with how it turned out and just have to finish it up by polishing and waxing it.</p>
